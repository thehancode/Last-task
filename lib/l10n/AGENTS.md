# Translation guide

`app_en.arb` is the source-language catalog and English is the default locale.
Every visible UI message belongs in this catalog. Keep each message key stable;
renaming a key breaks generated Dart call sites and every translation.

Last Task is the product name. Keep appTitle, windowTitle, and
workspaceTitle as Last Task in every locale; product names are not
translated.

## Adding or updating a translation

- Add or update `app_<language>.arb`, preserving every message key and every
  placeholder from `app_en.arb`.
- Read the `description` in the matching English `@key` metadata before
  translating. Preserve placeholders such as `{listName}` exactly, including
  their braces, and do not translate keyboard key names unless the platform
  convention requires it.
- This is a task-list application: use task/list/status vocabulary consistently.
  Do not translate task titles, list names, or custom tag names: they are user
  content.
- Keep button labels and dialog or panel titles short: prefer one or two words.
  Use the English source label's length as the space budget; choose a shorter
  Spanish equivalent when a direct translation would be noticeably longer.
- Run `flutter gen-l10n`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` after catalog
  changes. Update widget tests when visible English text intentionally changes.

## Language setting

Supported application languages are discovered from generated
`AppLocalizations.supportedLocales`. Adding a locale requires an ARB catalog
with its `@@locale` and a native `languageName` message. The language selector
then includes it automatically after `flutter gen-l10n`.
